**ProjectX** is the program run by Aficionados (Programming Society, NIT Goa) which aims at making newbies (**Cadets**) of campus aware about `fun, opportunities, challenges and realities` of Computer Science and its Sub-Streams. We believe that every student here at NITG should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it.

### How to get involved?
1. Cadets should apply for getting into teams based on Captains profile through this form. <br>
Freshmen :link: [Apply here](https://forms.gle/BnscLGJKTA8ifxKj9) <br>
Sophomores and Juniors :link: [Apply here](https://forms.gle/nHmUXq6ScjiRiPR98)
2. Specify your skill-set. `(Any MOOCs have taken before or any other relevant details)`
3. Captains will choose cadets(`from each junior year`) which they will take under their team.
4. Done.

> Just getting started with programming? You can also apply through the same link, we will provide you with a better platform to learn and practice efficiently

### Then What?
1. Captain will guide, help and mentor his team members.
2.  The Challenges will be floated span several genres, including Competitive Programming, Development, Open Source, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
3. Also, each team will choose a CS/IT topic and design relevant challenges on it. After knowing the topic other remaining teams will prepare for it, In which the captain will guide the team.
6. LeaderBoard and archive will be maintained in this repo.
